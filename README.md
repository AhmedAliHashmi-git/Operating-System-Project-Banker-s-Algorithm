# Operating-System-Project-Banker-s-Algorithm
This project is my Operating Systems final assignment, showcasing a GUI-based implementation of the Banker's Algorithm using C and the Qt framework. The application is designed to manage and prevent deadlock in resource allocation systems through an intuitive graphical interface.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: 
Built with Qt to provide a clean and responsive GUI.
Dynamic Resource Allocation: Simulates various scenarios of resource allocation and deadlock prevention.
Real-Time Visualization: Displays the state of resources, processes, and allocation requests in real time.
Educational Tool: Ideal for students and educators to understand the Banker's Algorithm in a visual and interactive manner.
Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Qt framework and a C compiler.
Installation: 
Step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project.
Usage: Detailed guide on how to use the application and explore its features
